This is the folder to host code snippets for [#9](https://github.com/flutter/uxr/issues/9) - there is more coming soon. Snippets are organized by the [scenarios](https://github.com/flutter/uxr/tree/master/nav2-usability/storyboards) they implement. You can run each snippet using an IDE or the following command:

```
flutter run -d Chrome -t {{path_to_snippet_file}}
```

To run code snippets written with the `auto_route` package, run the code generator first by following [these instructions](https://autoroute.vercel.app/introduction/installation_and_usage).
