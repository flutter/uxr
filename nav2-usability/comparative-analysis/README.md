# Flutter Router Package Comparative Analysis  
As part of the [Navigator 2.0 API Usability Research](https://github.com/flutter/uxr/wiki/Navigator-2.0-API-Usability-Research), we have conducted a [preliminary comparative analysis](https://github.com/flutter/uxr/issues/13) of existing router packages Flutter community has produced around common navigation scenarios ([PDF](https://github.com/flutter/uxr/blob/master/nav2-usability/storyboards/%5BPublic%5D%20Flutter%20Navigator%20Scenarios%20Storyboards%20v2.pdf)) the Flutter UX Research team has identified through previous user studies.

| **Deep Linking - Path Parameters** | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | ðŸ†‡ - in TODO list | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… - currently only work for root stack. Support for child stacks is in TODO list | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… |

| **Validation (Login/Logout/Sign-up Routing)** | âœ… - route validation happens at the route pattern level, but no custom validators (e.g. check if id is valid before routing) | âœ… - BeamGuard | ðŸ†‡ - in TODO list | ðŸ†‡ | âœ… | ðŸ†‡ - in TODO list | âœ… | âœ… | âœ… - no way to specify "default" route when validation fails (e.g. go to login/ screen if user is logged out) | âœ… | âœ… | âœ…- VNavigationGuard |

## What's Next  
Our immediate next step in the [Navigator 2.0 API Usability Research](https://github.com/flutter/uxr/wiki/Navigator-2.0-API-Usability-Research) is to conduct a more detailed evaluation ([#7](https://github.com/flutter/uxr/issues/7)) of usability benefits and disadvantages based on code snippets ([#9](https://github.com/flutter/uxr/issues/9)) provided by package authors based on the finalized navigator scenarios in [#4](https://github.com/flutter/uxr/issues/4). We have about 5 authors who expressed interest so far to participate in the next round and contribute code snippets for the usability evaluation. We will share a more detailed plan here: [#9](https://github.com/flutter/uxr/issues/9)
